Description: Imports Variant Calling Format file into R. It can detect
             whether a sample contains contaminant from the same species.
             In the first stage of the approach, a change-point detection
             method is used to identify copy number variations for filtering.
             Next, features are extracted from the data for a support vector
             machine model. For log-likelihood calculation, the deviation
             parameter is estimated by maximum likelihood method. Using
             a radial basis function kernel support vector machine, the
             contamination of a sample can be detected.
